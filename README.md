## Features
- CombatLog parsing with various statistics
- Real-time CombatLog parsing with overlays
- Screen parsing, both real-time and while file parsing, to provide more information
- An event-by-event overview of whole spawns
- An integrated Strategy Manager with collaborative editing features
- Graphs that show performance over time
- A set of tools to improve your GSF and GSF Parser experience
- Lots of settings to make the GSF Parser do what you want it to

## Issues and requests
If you would like to see a specific feature in the GSF Parser, or you have found a bug, feel free to create an issue
in the GitHub issue tracker of this repository. Of course you could also fork the project and write the code yourself,
but it is preferred that if you do want to write code, you add it here after being granted write access to the
repository.

## Building a release
If you would like to build a release of the GSF Parser yourself, all you need is a Python installation with the proper
requirements installed, and additionally PyInstaller to build the executable, all on a Windows platform. If you also
want to create a setup file, you'll need Inno Setup to build the setup script. You can find an interactive script in
`/release`, it will do everything automatically when you run it.

## Project dependencies
This project uses multiple dependencies, all of which are needed to run the GSF Parser correctly correctly from Source
Code.
- matplotlib, `pip install matplotlib`
- mock, `pip install mock`
- pillow, `pip install pillow`
- numpy, `pip install numpy`
- OpenCV-Python (version 3 or greater), `pip install opencv-python` on Windows and `sudo apt-get install python-opencv` on Debian based-systems
- [Python-MSS](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss), `pip install mss`


## Technical information

### File parsing
The GSF Parser can read the text files generated by Star Wars - The Old Republic to gather useful data about GSF
matches. Under the hood, this happens by going over the files line by line. Due to limitations of the data stored in
CombatLogs, not all data that can be found in in-game scoreboards can be reconstructed by the GSF Parser.

### Real-time parsing
By parsing the CombatLogs as they are created, the GSF Parser can gather data while you're in a GSF match. Not all of
this information is useful to everyone. Usually, the data in this section is only informative, not useful. Of course,
this changes when large sets of CombatLogs can be compared, such as in File Parsing.

### Screen parsing
To work around the limitations of CombatLogs, screen parsing was implemented. By taking screenshots on a short timer and
analyzing them, it is possible to extract much more data. The screenshots only exist in memory and are discarded when a
new one is taken, and when the GSF Parser is stopped the last one is destroyed as well. The GSF Parser does not interact
with the game executable in any way. The game must be in `Fullscreen (Windowed)` mode for this to be effective, and the
correct GUI profile must be selected.

### Overlays
Some of the data gathered while real-time parsing can be shown in an overlay. These overlays are actually windows, not
like a program like FRAPS (FRAPS injects its code into the DirectX9 EndScene call on a device, very difficult if not
impossible to do from a Python program, even with C++ code). That means that there are some limitations. The first one
is that due to the kernel, on Windows 7 players may experience frame-drops because of this, on Windows 8 and 10 this is
not the case. The second one is that the game must be in `Fullscreen (Windowed)` graphics mode.
