These classes use data in a dictionary structure, dumped to a file in the temporary directory of the GSF Parser. This
dictionary contains all the data acquired by screen parsing and is stored with the following structure:

Dictionary structure:
data_dictionary[filename] = file_dictionary
file_dictionary[datetime_obj] = match_dictionary
match_dictionary[datetime_obj] = spawn_dictionary
spawn_dictionary["power_mgmt"] = power_mgmt_dict
    power_mgmt_dict[datetime_obj] = integer

    cursor_pos_dict[datetime_obj] = (x, y)
spawn_dictionary["tracking"] = tracking_dict
    tracking_dict[datetime_obj] = percentage
spawn_dictionary["clicks"] = clicks_dict
    clicks_dict[datetime_obj] = (left, right)
spawn_dictionary["keys"] = keys_dict
    keys_dict[datetime_obj] = keyname
spawn_dictionary["health"] = health_dict
    health_dict[datetime_obj] = (hull, shieldsf, shieldsr), all ints
spawn_dictionary["distance"] = distance_dict
    distance_dict[datetime_obj] = distance, int

The realtime screen parsing uses Queue objects to communicate with other parts of the program. This is required because
the screen parsing takes place in a separate process for performance optimization and itself runs several threads to
monitor mouse and keyboard activity. This only gets recorded if the user is in a match, for otherwise it might be
possible to extract keylogs of different periods, and this would impose an extremely dangerous security issue. The Queue
objects used by the ScreenParser object are the following:

data_queue:         This Queue object receives any data from the realtime file parsing that is relevant for the
                    Screen Parser object. This includes data about the file watched, the match detected, the spawn
                    detected and other information. A list of expected data:
                    - ("file", str new_file_name)           new CombatLog watched
                    - ("match", True, datetime)             new match started
                    - ("match", False, datetime)            match ended
                    - ("spawn", datetime)                   new spawn
exit_queue:         This Queue object is checked to see if the ScreenParser should stop running or not. Because this
                    is running in a separate process, one cannot just simply call __exit__, all pending operations
                    must first be completed. A list of expected data:
                    - True                                  keep running
                    - False                                 exit ASAP
query_queue         This Queue object is for communication between the process and the realtime parsing thread in the
                    main process so the main process can receive data and display it in the overlay. A list of
                    expected data:
                    - "power_mgmt"                          return int power_mgmt
                    - "tracking"                            return int tracking degrees
                    - "health"                              return (hull, shieldsf, shieldsr), all ints
return_queue        The Queue in which the data requested from the query_queue is returned.
_internal_queue:    This Queue object is for internal communication between the various Thread objects running in this
                    Process object. A list of expected data:
                    - ("keypress", *args)                   key pressed
                    - ("mousepress", *args)                 mouse button pressed
                    - ("mouserelease", *args)               mouse button released
                    This is not yet a complete list.
