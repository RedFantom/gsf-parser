    A new LogStalker class (compared to the LogStalker class in stalking.py),
    that provides a new way of reading CombatLogs for less IO usage and a more
    stable back-end.
    Trade-off is that the datetime.datetime.strptime every time makes the
    process take longer to pick-up on changes, due to the required processing
    time of the datetime functions.
    LogStalker classes are completely interchangable and compatible with the
    current code, only the import statement in realtimeframe.py must be
    changed.
